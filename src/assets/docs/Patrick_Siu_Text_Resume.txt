Experience
Lead Data Engineer (Financial Crimes) TikTok U.S. Data Security 5/2024 – Present
• Team Leadership & Strategy: Built and led a 12-person engineering team from the ground up, establishing core
SDLC standards, code review protocols, and modular design patterns that boosted output and auditability.
• Petabyte-Scale Architecture: Architected a multi-region data platform on ByteCloud (abstracted layer over
Oracle Cloud and AWS) managing 4PB+ of data. utilized Dorado (Databricks / Spark) and HDFS to optimize
storage costs and query performance.
• GenAI & LLM Implementation: Delivered production-grade LLM ecosystems by integrating Agentic AI
workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and RAG pipelines. Built using LangChain, VikingDB (in-house
Milvus equivalent), and Gemini 3 to ensure high-fidelity, context-aware interoperability.
• Orchestration & Automation: Automating critical investigative operations and reducing manual effort by
implementing Dorado modular multi-stage pipelines for complex DAG dependency management and
leveraging TCE (in-house Kubernetes) for scalable execution.
• Data Governance & Quality: Drove a data quality transformation by instituting a custom data governance
ruleset, a centralized data library, and proactive monitoring to ensure department-wide trustworthiness and
secure access control.
• Analytics & Observability: Delivered 20+ dashboards for risk and operations metrics using Aeolus (in-house
Tableau), supported by a custom contextual alerting system with direct integration with Lark (in-house Slack
messaging)
Specialist (Data Engineer: Data Scanning) TikTok U.S. Data Security 5/2023 – 5/2024
• Containerized Scale Architecture: Designed and implemented a massive-scale compliance scanning framework
using a custom distributed orchestration framework leveraging the Dorado API to manage parallel processing
across 30,000 compute cores and 60 TB memory.
• Performance Optimization: Achieved a 270x increase in scanning speed by refactoring legacy scripts and
automation structure for HDFS, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Elastic Search. Optimized resource contention
using throttling and load detection to prevent overwhelming sensitive data sources such as production
databases.
• Big Data at Scale: Extended privacy scanning coverage to 6 exabytes of data by engineering a custom bridge
through Linux to integrate Nuix scanning capabilities directly with HDFS storage, before we created our own
in-house capability
• Regulatory Impact: Generated compliance reports from our scanning system, which were publicly presented as
primary evidence during Congressional hearings on data security.
Specialist (Data Engineer: Bot Detection) Bytedance (TikTok) 10/2021 – 5/2023
• Bot Detection Architecture: Led a team of 9 to engineer a daily automated pipeline processing 1 billion user
accounts to detect 14M inauthentic accounts daily.
• Defense Efficacy: Achieved a 94% incremental detection rate (catching actors missed by standard defenses) by
engineering features based on behavioral velocity such as coordinated spike engagement, activity interarrival
times, no sleep patterns, etc.
• App Intel Monitoring: Built a scraping and monitoring system using Python+Beautiful Soup and DAG Hive
orchestration to inventory the global Bytedance app footprint. Automated real-time alerts via Lark Webhooks
to flag privacy vulnerabilities and popularity shifts.
• Forensic Investigation: Served as the dedicated technical investigator for 3 P&C litigation cases, executing
complex forensic data retrieval queries across multiple departments to prepare corporate depositions under
tight legal deadlines.
• Thought Leadership: Selected by professor Dr. Holly Russo and Dr. Randy Garrett to lecture on Data
Visualization architectures at George Mason University, representing Bytedance’s technical expertise to
graduate-level Data Science cohorts.
Principal Data Scientist (DataCloud) ADP 11/2020 – 10/2021
• AWS Pipeline Automation: Engineered automated data delivery pipelines utilizing AWS Step Functions for the
Data Licensing business, replacing manual workflows to improve reliability and speed.
• Monetization Analytics: Architected a ”live” revenue and KPI dashboard suite for API monetization using
Tableau, enabling real-time decision-making on high-volume transaction data.
Lead Data Scientist (Infrastructure & Strategy) ADP 11/2018 – 11/2020
• Greenfield Infrastructure: Built the BI and analytics infrastructure from the ground up for the ”Wisely Direct”
startup unit, utilizing Docker containers for portability and Airflow for orchestration.
• Data Silo Unification: Consolidated 13 disparate data silos into a unified Redshift and Postgres data
warehouse, enabling the first comprehensive view of the business.
• Strategic ETL: Developed end-to-end Python ETL pipelines to support a $700M digital transformation
portfolio, strategically guiding funding allocation through data-driven retention modeling.
Lead Data Scientist (NLP & Client Experience) ADP 5/2014 – 11/2018
• NLP & Text Mining: Engineered an enterprise-grade NLP engine using R openNLP to classify 9M+
unstructured service logs, achieving 88% precision and expanding topic coverage from 26 to 442 categories.
• Speech Analytics: Delivered a Proof-of-Concept (POC) speech-to-text pipeline using Nice CX combined with
sentiment analysis to identify key call volume drivers.
• Enterprise Visualization: Stood up and automated the first enterprise-wide Tableau dashboard ecosystem to
standardize performance measurement across all business units.
